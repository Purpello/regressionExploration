# Regression Exploration

The PDF file in this repository describes an exploration of simulated data using two approaches to regression - one using the 'lm' function in R and the other using the AutoML capabilties of H2O.  The simulated data used is included as well as the python notebook used to generate the simulated data and the R file used.
